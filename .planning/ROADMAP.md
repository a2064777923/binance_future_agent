## Requirement Coverage

- v1.0 requirements: archived at `.planning/milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- v1.1-v1.21 requirements: archived at `.planning/milestones/v1.21-REQUIREMENTS.md`

## Next Step

Start the next milestone with `$gsd-new-milestone`, or continue live operations
by observing HYPEUSDT. Do not change the active server risk profile while
HYPEUSDT remains open. After it closes, run `ops reconcile-outcomes
--persist-closed`, then `ops risk-change-check --target-leverage 8`; apply the
`30u_8x_dynamic` profile only if that gate returns allowed and the operator
supplies the exact confirmation token.
